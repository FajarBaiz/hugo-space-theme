To check your version of Hugo, run:

hugo version
This will output the currently installed version of Hugo. Make sure you see /extended after the version number, for example Hugo Static Site Generator v0.51/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown You do not need to use version v0.51 specifically, you can use any version of Hugo above 0.51. It just needs to have the /extended part
